Hello Shane,

I wanted to inform you that I have successfully completed the property change request for James. The form will now be forwarded to our internal Rangewater team for further processing, including the provision of additional software such as Yardi, Entrata, and Realpage.

If you require any additional assistance or have further inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to help. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!

Warm regards,
Christopher Grissette
