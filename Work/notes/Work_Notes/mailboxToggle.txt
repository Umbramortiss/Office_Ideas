Hello Kimberlee,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm here to help you set up the email toggle feature in Outlook, making it seamless for you to switch between mailboxes when sending emails.

Would it be convenient for me to access your computer remotely at a time that suits you best?

Thank you for your cooperation.

Warm regards,

Christopher Grissette
