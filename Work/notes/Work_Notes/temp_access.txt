Dear Michell,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that Brandon was granted temporary access to Magnolia House's property Share Drive and email on Tuesday, December 19th, as per your request. I wanted to remind you that Brandon's access will be removed on January 5th.

Therefore, I will be forwarding this form to our internal Rangewater team to provide additional software such as Yardi, Entrata, and Realpage.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any further assistance. Wishing you a great day!

Best regards,
Christopher Grissette
