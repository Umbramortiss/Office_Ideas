Hello Briston,

I have completed the onboarding process for your ACD Karyn Paz.

I have emailed their named email credentials securely via Mimecast.

If you have not logged into Mimecast before you will have to hit the Forgot Password button, and create a new password to view secure emails sent via Mimecast.

I have attached screenshots below.

If you are in need of further assistance do not hesitate to reach out to us, I hope you have a wonderful day!

Best Regards,
Christopher Grissette
